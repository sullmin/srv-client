This is my first server/client in c, using TCP.
To use it, you have to use compile the source files.
Thus, you can use the Makefile in ./client and in ./serv.
After, that you have two binary file: run_client and run_server.

At first run the binary run_server :
./run_server (run with default params PORT : 8080)
./run_server PORT_VALUE (run with port value in first params)

In second time, the client can connect:
./run_client (run with default params PORT : 8080 IP : 127.0.0.1)
./run_client PORT_VALUE PORT_VALUE

How to use client:
1. write your message in terminal en press ENTER for send msg
2. In your message, you can use flag like this : "<Red><Undelined>test" print "test" in red and underline
3. You can execute commande using "//"
    - list : list of commande
    - clear : clear the terminal
    - send : send file with the filepath "//send img.png"
    - color : list of flag in message
    - shutdown : end of program
